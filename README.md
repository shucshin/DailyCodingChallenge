# DailyCodingChallenge
This is a repository to upload all my daily programming journey along with my permanent competitive programming teammates [Kary-AG](https://github.com/Kary-AG) and [AlbertNath](https://github.com/AlbertNath)

This idea was set to force myself to program every single day which is crucial to become better in less time.

The content will be based on algorithmic problems from platforms such as Codeforces, AtCoder, HackerRank, LeetCode, etc.

The challenge finishes when I get admitted to any company from FAANG as a Software Engineer.
