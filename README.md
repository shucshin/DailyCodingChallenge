# DailyCodingChallenge
This is a repository to upload all my daily competitive programming journey to record my improvement progress.

This idea was set to force myself to program every single day which is crucial to become better in less time.

The content will be based on algorithmic problems from platforms such as Codeforces, AtCoder, HackerRank, LeetCode, etc.

The challenge finishes when I get admitted to any company from FAANG as a Software Engineer.

First problem solved with C++ on June 14th, 2021.

July-2021 and August-2021 skipped due to daily work of 13hrs.

Started solving all problems from [CP4](https://cpbook.net/details?cp=4) since January 2023.
